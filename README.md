# My Todo App

This is a simple to-do application built using Python and Streamlit. It allows users to add, manage, and complete tasks in a to-do list. The application is designed to help improve productivity by keeping track of tasks in a clean and interactive interface.
Features

    Add new to-do items dynamically
    Mark items as completed by checking them off
    Automatically remove completed tasks from the list
    Simple and interactive web interface

Requirements

To run this application, you need the following Python libraries:

    Streamlit
    A custom functions.py file (explained below)

You can install Streamlit using pip:

bash

pip install streamlit

functions.py

The functions.py file should contain two functions to handle reading and writing tasks from a text file:

    get_todos(): Reads the current list of to-do items from a file and returns them as a list.
    write_todos(todos): Writes the updated list of to-do items back to the file.

Example of functions.py:

python

def get_todos():
    """Reads a text file and returns a list of to-do items."""
    with open("todos.txt", "r") as file:
        todos = file.readlines()
    return todos

def write_todos(todos):
    """Writes the list of to-do items to a text file."""
    with open("todos.txt", "w") as file:
        file.writelines(todos)

How to Run

    Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
    Install the required libraries using pip:

    bash

pip install streamlit

Ensure you have the functions.py file in the same directory as the main application code.
Run the Streamlit app using:

bash

    streamlit run your_todo_app.py

Application Interface

    Add: Type in a new to-do item and press Enter. The task will be added to the list.
    Complete: Click the checkbox next to a task to mark it as completed. The task will be removed from the list automatically.
    Live Updates: The app automatically updates the task list as tasks are added or completed.
